# Used-Cars
Dataset was used to find patterns and variations using a plethora of data visualisation techniques as well as Pearson’s correlation coefficient. 
Irrelevant data was dropped completely and values were imputed wherever possible for the pertinent data. 
Data was normalised and standardised for easier understanding and processing. 
Finally,a hypothesis was tested on the dataset using Student’s T-test and found to be true. 
The main aim was to explore the used car market and its inner workings and further draw conclusions with the available data.
